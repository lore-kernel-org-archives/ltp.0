So why make it standalone and not replace the old LTP kdump test suite
with this new one?

Well, preparing custom initramfs will become very tricky. We used
to do that and finally we switched to dracut.

Why not simply let the respective service on the host do this job and
test only makes sure that kdump service is running. It feels little
out of place that a test is generating custom initramfs.

makedumpfile will reduce the vmcore file size to few hundreds of mega
bytes on most of the systems. Especially, this is just a test, so 
system will be lightly loaded and vmcore will be small after filtering.

If there is not enough space, test fails, period. I don't think there
is any need to try to circumvent that and try to run crash in initramfs.
And in the process we don't test makedumpfile which is very imporatnt
component of this whole process.

IMHO, just rely on "systemctl start kdump" to generate and load custom
initramfs and save filtered vmcore to root fs by default and alanyze
vmcore post reboot. That will keep things simple.
