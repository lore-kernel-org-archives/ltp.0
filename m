Completely agree.

Even if you go ahead with these changes, they really should go through
some kind of distro verification [1]. If I even contemplated such a change
in glibc I'd run it through 4-6 months of Fedora Rawhide builds just to
see what breaks before putting it out in a real release (and we do this
frequently for thread-related changes).
