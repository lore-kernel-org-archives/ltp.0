While I agree that the chances of breakage may be quite small (though
I certainly won't be so bold as to assert that only test suites
will get broken), your comment misses the important metapoint:
changes like this should not just be getting waved through the gate
without some analysis along the lines of what I did. "Consistency"
and an (incorrect) assertion that "In most cases, EPERM is returned
on immutable inode" just don't cut it, when it comes to making
changes of this sort.

No. That is not a strategy. I already said it, but I'll say it again:
sometimes these reports only arrive many months or even years later.
And then we can end up with fiascoes such as F_SETOWN/F_SETOWN_EX.
(Essentially: F_SETOWN got subtly changed, and by the time people
realized the breakage had occurred it was *years* late. Too late to
revert... So, then we got F_SETOWN_EX to allow us what F_SETOWN
used to do. See fcntl(2).)

Also not a strategy; distros don't want to carry such junk
patches.

All of this said, I still don't know whether reverting the patch
is warranted...

Cheers,

Michael
