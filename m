How many processor architecture characteristics do you know already?

* Is a string pointer often longer than a byte?

* I imagine that it can become also interesting to check byte level data ac=
cess
  under constraints of machine word sizes and alignment.

How much would you trust in any concrete numbers I could present
for this use case?

Do you give more trust to a reference testing platform?

This is also possible in principle.

How many results would we like to clarify from various hardware
and software combinations?

Thanks for this information.

How important are the mentioned functions for you within the Linux
programming interface so far?

ed.

Which data would you accept as a "prove" in this case?

Interesting view =E2=80=A6

How common is the discussed software transformation between implementations
for optimising compilers?

Which software versions and command parameters did you try out
for this information (from an unspecified run time environment)?

I agree that there are system properties and constraints which can be
considered further.
