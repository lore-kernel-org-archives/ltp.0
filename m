Which is a bug in the application build - if you are doing anything
with XFS, you need to define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE. No ifs, buts or
maybes - it's a 64 bit filesystem with 64 bit interfaces (e.g.
ioctls) and so applications that include XFS headers to poke at XFS
filesystems need to fully support 64 bit file offsets....

We're only going to get stricter on this - next cycle we're removing
off64_t and replacing it with off_t, and then we'll be /explicitly/
breaking the build of any application that hasn't set up it's build
environment to define off_t as a 64 bit variable.  i.e.  specifying
_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE before the inclusion of XFS headers will be a
mandatory requirement - that's far better than ending up with clean
builds and subtly broken applications...

Cheers,

Dave.
