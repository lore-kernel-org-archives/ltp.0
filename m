It's arch/arm/mm/alignment.c rsp. arch/mips/kernel/unaliged.c.

Yes; but the checks that unaligned.c does on MIPS are no different from
any other get_user(), that is it ensures that the entire 8/16/32/64-bit
access is in userspace.  That's done using access_ok().

The MIPS psABI of which the Linux/MIPS ABI is sort of derived doesn't
specify any alignment-specific behaviour for syscalls.  That is they're not
treated any different than any random piece of library code.  I don't
know of any other standards documents (POSIX, single UNIX etc.) that
would have anything relevant either.

There are several historic precedents for why Linux handles miss-alignment
this way:

  o The networking stack where some cards may align the header in memory
    such that IP addresses are always on an address that is aligned to a
    16-bit but not a 32-bit boundary.  The tulip cards do that for example.
    It was considered a better solution to emulate the access or copy the
    entire rx packet before further processing than hacking up the
    networking stack to handle with ill-designed hardware.

  o Another in-kernel case was the MS-DOS partition table parsing.

  o The were also a bunch of historic Linux applications originally written
    for x86 which were relativly hard to port, so generally handling
    exceptions, was the by far easiest thing to do and probably for most
    architectures where this is relevant it's the easiest to handle all
    miss-alignment cases, not just selectively userland and maybe IP and
    MS-DOS partition table parsing.

We've moved on.  Handling miss-alignment is no longer a very relavent part
of the syscall interface.  So I think for the definition of the Linux
ABI this should just be left as implementation defined behaviour but
whatever an architecture does, it should be done consistently for all
system interfaces.
