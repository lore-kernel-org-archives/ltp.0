Ping.

The affected kernel code as well as fix commits are now in v4.19.
Pushed rebased branch to:
https://github.com/amir73il/ltp/commits/overlayfs-devel

Also, there is an unrelated (besides the word "fadvise") cleanup branch
https://github.com/amir73il/ltp/commits/fadvise_cleanup
that converts the fadvise tests to newlib.

Thanks,
Amir.
