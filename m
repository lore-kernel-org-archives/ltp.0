Subject: [LTP] [PATCH v4,
 0/2] cgroup/cgroup_regression_test: Fix umount failure

The test sequence
	mount -t cgroup -o <controllers> <path>
	mkdir <path>/<dir>
	rmdir <path>/<dir>
	umount <path>
	mount -t cgroup -o <controllers> <path>
would easily fail at the last mount with -EBUSY on certain platform.

Adding a little delay between "rmdir" and "umount" could fix the problem,
so use tst_umount API instead of umount in "rmdir, umount" sequence.

Changes since v1
- Use "tst_umount" instead of "sync" as suggested
- Make "tst_umount" work with argument that has terminating slash

Changes since v2
- Filter out the trailing slash instead of using mountpoint command

Changes since v3
- Filter out the trailing slash only in grep command
- Add comment in the test script
