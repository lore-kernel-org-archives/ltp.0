Good news everyone,

the Linux Test Project test suite stable release for *May 2018* has been
released.

Since the last release 297 patches by 38 authors were merged.

NOTABLE CHANGES
===============

 * New testcases:

   - two inotify regression tests for:
     764baba80168 ("ovl: hash non-dir by lower inode for fsnotify")
     31747eda41ef ("ovl: hash directory inodes for fsnotify")

   - sysclt01 a regression test for:
     5ccba44ba118 ("sched/sysctl: Check user input value of sysctl_sched_time_avg")

   - CVE regression tests for:
     * CVE-2017-17053 - ccd5b3235180 ("x86/mm: Fix use-after-free of ldt_struct")
     * CVE-2017-16939 - 1137b5e2529a ("ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash")
     * CVE-2015-3290  - 9b6e6a8334d5 ("x86/nmi/64: Switch stacks on userspace NMI entry")
     * CVE-2017-17052 - 2b7e8665b4ff ("fork: fix incorrect fput of ->exe_file causing use-after-free")
     * CVE-2017-17807 - 4dca6ea1d943 ("KEYS: add missing permission check for request_key() destination")

   - read_all

     Test that aims to stress test /proc, /sys, and safe subset of /dev
     filesystems by reading by reading each readable file using several
     threads.

   - The pwritev03 and preadv03 tests with O_DIRECT executed on all supported filesystems.
     (https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Test-Writing-Guidelines#2214-testing-with-a-block-device)

   - Pids controller tests fixed a race that made them fail sporadically and
     the the coverage was increased.

   - pwrite03, write02

     Write syscall tests for special case with NULL buffer and len 0
     where the call is expected to return 0 i.e. success.

 * Removed outdated and broken tests
   - sssd daemon test
   - mail command test
   - ht_interrupt -- hyperthreading interrupt balancing test

 * 54 testcases were cleaned up and converted to the new test library

 * The syscalls testrun has been speeded up by about a minute which is 5% of the runtime.

 * Several Android fixes have been applied.

 * New macro for automatic retry with exponential backoff has been added to the
   test library, which should replace all the ad-hoc retry loops we do have all
   around the codebase.

 * IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) tests
   - Were rewritten to use new API, updated, and various bugs has been fixed.
   - The most important changes:
     * Avoid running on tmpfs ima_measurements.sh and ima_violations.sh
     * ima_measurements.sh: support new IMA measurement templates, support testing
       most of IMA supported hash algorithms, fix & update iversion check
     * tpm.sh: replace ima_measure with evmctl (external)
     * ima_policy.sh: improve check of policy writability
     * ima_boot_aggregate: fixing event size for modern BIOS

     Many thanks to Mimi Zohar for her review and testing of IMA test cases.

  + The usual number of fixes and cleanups all over the place

NETWORK TESTS
=============

 Changelog for network tests brought to you by Peter Vorel.

 * New testcases:
   - for IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT, DCCP and UDP ipsec and for UDPLITE protocol
   - regression test sctp_big_chunk aka CVE-2018-5803
   - netstress gained support for IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT, SO_ZEROCOPY flags
     and UDPLITE protocol
   - Use libtirpc for all RPC tests

  * Test cases rewritten into new shell API:
    - interface and multicast tests cases
    - in6_02

  * Removed tests cases
    - route{4,6}-ifdown

  + Various fixes and doc cleanups


TODO LIST AND ISSUE TRACKER
===========================

Just recently we started to maintain a LTP TODO list in the form GitHub issues,
so far there is very coarse list of missing, mostly syscall, coverage:

https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/labels/missing%20coverage

Which I suppose will expand quite a bit soon.

And also nearly empty list of reproducers:

https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/labels/reproducer

Which I'm about to feed with a list of CVE reproducers I have, that
can be converted into regression testcases.

Lastly but not least I would like to ask everyone to contribute to that list.
