Hi all,

I am trying to solve problem with mmap syscall on Microblaze which I have.
I am running mmap01 test program from LTP. In attachment is hacked
version and inline version is below too.

Here is the simple mmap test description
1. open temp file
2. write there hello word (in my case ABCD\n EFGH\n - for better tracing
0x41424344 0a20 45464748 0a20)
3. then find a place for allocation of mmap
4. before mmap fill this place with A - whole place (0x41 in hex)
5. then called mmap - map file with string to place which was filled by A.
6a. Correct behavior is that this place must contain only the same data
as was in file (not any A chars) (the rest of chars should be zero)
6b. Wrong behavior is that this place contain any (0x41) data - which is
my case

The facts which I know:
1. Problem is not relate with caches - We tried to run in on system
without cache and the problem is the same
2. Microblaze implementation of sys_mmap02 is the same as is for sparc,
blackfin, m68k and others.
Arnd: Anyway maybe worth to move sys_mmap2 to any generic location. What
do you think?

I copy&paste two output of that program. First checking loop show that
there are old data and second that
data are correct from address 0x10026010. Every run I am getting
different values - sometimes

First log
# ./mmap

If I add any code which do any loop for delay program a little bit -
program passed that's why
I think that my problem could be related with any timing issue.
I tried to run that test on x86 and there is no problem with that test
but doesn't mean that
the problem is not there too (just x86 is much faster than Microblaze)

Do you have any idea what could be wrong?

Thanks for your hints,
Michal
