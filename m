Cyril,

The following series adds test covergae for readahead() syscall
over overlayfs file and adds test coverage for a specific
posix_fadvise() syscall advice (POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED).

So far, the posix_fadvise syscall tests in LTP only test for error
conditions, but not functionality.

The functionality of the advice POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED is identical
to readahead() and since kernel commit 3d8f7615319b ("vfs: implement
readahead(2) using POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED"), the implementations are
also bound together.

To add test coverage of the advice POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED, I decided not
to duplicate the readahead() functional test and add test cases to
readahead02 that use the POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED implementation.

Thanks,
Amir.

Changes since v2:
- Runtime check for readahead/fadvise support
- Abort test case immediately if syscall fail

Changes since v1:
- Fix bugs in loop invocation of test (i.e. -i 2)
- Address review comments from Jan Stancek
- Make cached_max a global maximum over all test cases
- Improve reliability of overlayfs readahead test case failure

  syscalls/readahead02: Convert to newlib and cleanup
  syscalls/readahead02: abort test if readahead syscall fails
  syscalls/readahead02: test readahead() on an overlayfs file
  syscalls/readahead02: test readahead using posix_fadvise()
  syscalls/readahead02: fail test if readahead did not use any cache
