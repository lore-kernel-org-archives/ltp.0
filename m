Always.

(Which up to now I thought was basic programming knowledge...)

So, another test for you to do.

At the moment _any_ test would do.
With every response from your side you just keep on asking further
questions. But so far you haven't delivered any answers nor measurements.

No, this is what's going to happen if you don't show any measurements.

See above. At the moment _any_ test result from your side would do.

Not very. The interface is only used in a slow path, and the execution
time doesn't affect I/O performance in any way.

Again: You want something from us. We don't have to prove anything, you
need to convince us. And it is really hard to convince anyone by asking
questions.

_I_ did some measurements.
I'm still waiting from results from your side.
