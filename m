I only push out the -rc git tree when I am at a "stopping point" in work
on the stable tree.  If I added this patch earlier today, I have not
pushed out a new -rc.  Please work off of the stable-queue.git tree
instead if you want to always see the latest version of what I have
applied to the queue.

thanks,
