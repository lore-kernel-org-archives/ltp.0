Oops. better fix it anyway.
I think it matters if /proc/pid/io does not exist.

I don't know. Not sure which tests are good candidates for that.
But anyway it's a different change.

or if it was tmpfs we created a loop backed default fs (ext2?).

Now we skip the conditional part and always format fs.
Do you think that matters for the test?
