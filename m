Jan, thanks for spotting this.

I'm not so sure about that. In Eryu's patch (which *really, really*
should have CCed linux-api@, and it would be kind if subsystem
maintainers reminded patch submitters about that), there was this
change:

[[
--- a/fs/namei.c
+++ b/fs/namei.c

inode *inode, int mask)

 int __inode_permission(struct inode *inode, int mask)
 {
        int retval;

        if (unlikely(mask & MAY_WRITE)) {
                /*
                 * Nobody gets write access to an immutable file.
                 */
                if (IS_IMMUTABLE(inode))
-                       return -EACCES;
+                       return -EPERM;

                /*

                if (HAS_UNMAPPED_ID(inode))
                        return -EACCES;
        }

        retval = do_inode_permission(inode, mask);
]]

[1] The effects of that change are pretty wide ranging, affecting
open(2)/openat(2) (of an existing file for writing),
access(2)/faccessat(2) (W_OK), and [f]truncate(2). In addition, there
is the observed change (from another part of the patch) in
utimensat(2) (and friends). Those cases formerly gave EACCES for
immutable files, now they give EPERM.

[2] By contrast, the following always gave EPERM: fallocate(2),
setxattr(2), unlink(2), link(2) [in certain cases], chown(2),
chmod(2), and some per-filesystem cases of operations such as
truncate.

I agree that the inconsistency in the error return for immutable files
is unfortunate. But, consider the following:

* Although the set of calls in [1] is shorter, they (in particular,
  open(2)) are probably much more commonly used than
  the system calls in [2]. (That is, Eryu's statement "In most cases,
  EPERM is returned on immutable inode" that accompanied the
  kernel patch isn't correct.)
* For access(W_OK), we introduced a new error (EPERM) that
  previously never previously occurred. If there are applications
  that use access() and check specific error returns, they'll be
  confused. (I acknowledge there may be few such applications.)
* We changed the carefully documented behavior of utimensat(2)
  (and friends). [Read the man page!]
* EACCES is the typical error for "file not writable" (because of file
  permissions or other reasons such as immutability). It's long
  been the behavior for open(O_WRONLY/O_RDWR) on immutable
  files; now that has changed.
* Now various man pages need to document two different (kernel
  version dependent) errors for immutable files (for the syscalls in [1],
  above), and applications may need to deal with those two errors.

Summary of the above list: there's a nontrivial risk that something in
userspace got broken. (And just because we didn't hear about it yet
doesn't mean it didn't happen; sometimes these reports only arrive
many months or even years later.)

So, (1) I'm struggling to see the rationale for this change (I don't
think "consistency" is enough) and (2) if "consistency" is the
argument then (because the set of system calls in [1] are more
frequently used than those in [2]), there's a reasonable argument that
the change should have gone the other way: changing all IS_IMMUTABLE
cases to fail with EACCES.

Summary: I think there's an argument for reverting the kernel patch.

Cheers,

Michael
