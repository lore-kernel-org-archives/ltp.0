Subject: [LTP] [PATCH v2 0/2] IMA: Add test for dm-crypt measurement

New functionality is being added to IMA to measure data provided by
kernel components. With this feature, IMA policy can be set to enable
measuring data provided by device-mapper targets. Currently one such
device-mapper target - dm-crypt, is being updated to use this
functionality. This new functionality needs test automation in LTP.

Some of the existing functionality in ima_keys.sh can be reused for
this, but it needs to be refactored into generic functions first.

Add a testcase which verifies that the IMA subsystem correctly measures
the data coming from a device-mapper target - dm-crypt.
Refactor common functionality in ima_keys.sh for this, and move the
generic functions to ima_setup.sh.

This series needs a kernel built on the following repo/branch/patches:
 repo: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zohar/linux-integrity.git
 branch: next-integrity
 commit aa662fc04f5b ("ima: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ima_file_hash")

And the following patch series should be applied in the following order:
 1. https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11795559/
 2. https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11801525/
 3. https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11743715/

Change Log v2:
Incorporated feedback from Petr Vorel on v1.
 - Updated TST_NEEDS_CMDS to correctly reflects commands used in tests.
 - Removed unnecessary debugging info.
 - Refactored common functionality in ima_keys.sh, and moved the generic
   functions to ima_setup.sh.
 - Removed the use of eval, and replaced it with the recommended ROD()
   function.
 - All temporary files now get created under $TST_TMPDIR, instead of
   current directory.
 - Removed unnecessary TFAIL, to avoid double counting failures.
 - Updated log messages to be consistent.
 - Moved code to cleanup() to avoid code duplication.
