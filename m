Ah, right, I should have done git grep before commiting this. I will fix
that right away.

Agreed, I'm always against working around kernel bugs/deficiencies in
tests, unfortunately that usually conflicts with QA deparenments that
wants to skip known problems and have everything green. So we usually
end up somewhere in a middle ground.

Also as usuall, do you care enough to send a patch? :-)

Once it's fixed we can change that to a failure for new enough kernels,
old ones should probably stay with SKIPPED/TCONF.
