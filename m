I think that especially for this case get/put_user (+ user_copy macros)
kernel can do it because just copy/paste data from user space and data
can be unaligned.

it is ok.

Not sure about this idea because I think we have to use unaligned access for kernel too.
Your idea to skip unaligned access for kernel code should work but I think we have to find out
a solution for case when we need to use it in kernel code.

My idea was


void bad_page_fault()
{
	fixup = search_exception_tables(regs->pc);
	if (fixup) {
		regs->pc = fixup->fixup;
		return;
	}

	fixup = search_exception_tables(unaligned exception addr & 0xffff fffc) //mask last 2bits to get
aligned address
	if (fixup) {
		regs->pc = fixup->fixup;
		return;
	}

	die();

}


but not sure if will work because this setup bad fixup. In case that tlb load correct data
and kernel is able to access that place then unaligned exception needn't caused next page fault
and exception handler can load that value.

Maybe this could be work.
