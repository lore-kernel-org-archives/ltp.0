No, not your fault - the XFS headers have never made this clear.  In
the past we've tried to hide this requirement by using
glibc-specific types and it wasn't until we changed stuff to support
C libraries other than glibc for building xfsprogs that it became
clear that we needed to be explicit about this requirement.

This was an unintentional "first warning" that there may be bugs
lurking in 32 bit application builds. It's when the first app build
failure reports started coming that we realised there was a bigger
problem we needed to fix.  :/

Yup, that's exactly what it will do. It's part of a cleanup of
xfsprogs to simply use LFS for ensuring everything is 64 bit clean
when we build. last set of patches for this were posted here:

http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2016-08/msg00390.html

And this is the one that will break the build if off_t is not a
64 bit size:

http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2016-08/msg00402.html

I'm hoping to get this in the next xfsprogs cycle....

Cheers,

Dave.
