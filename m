That would be fine by me.

It does.
Overlayfs may behave differently on different underlying filesystems
depending on their characteristics.

It does not make sense to treat overlayfs as another filesystem in
all_filesystem tests IMO because:
- "overlayfs" is not a well defined setup, you will need to define the
  underlying filesystem as well, and which one will it be?
- For good test coverage it is best to test, for each fs
  test over fs directly, test over overlayfs + with fs as underlying fs

Thanks,
Amir.
