I was trying to mimic the check in posix_fadvise tests:

        /* Check this system has fadvise64 system which is used
           in posix_fadvise. */
        if ((_FILE_OFFSET_BITS != 64) && (__NR_fadvise64 == 0)) {
                tst_resm(TWARN,
                         "This test can only run on kernels that implements ");
                tst_resm(TWARN, "fadvise64 which is used from posix_fadvise");
                exit(0);
        }

If my understanding of man posix_fadvise(2) is correct, this wants to make sure
that the glibc wrapper posix_fadvise calls the syscall fadvise64 and not some
architecture specific syscall (e.g. arm_fadvise64_64).

I am not really sure why that matters to those tests at all.
and it's probably better just return TCONF if the call fails with ENOSYS?
If someone has ideas, let me know.

Thanks,
Amir.
