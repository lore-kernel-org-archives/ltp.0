No, you would have to effectively binary search on -E2BIG at the moment.
CHECK_FIELDS is a proposal I have which would allow you to get get the
size of the in-kernel struct, but it's still a proposal.

In theory you could get the size through BTF, but it's probably more
effort than it's worth to implement that.
