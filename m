FAN_FS_ERROR is a new (still unmerged) fanotify event to monitor
fileystem errors.  This patchset introduces a new LTP test for this
feature.

Testing file system errors is slightly tricky, in particular because
they are mostly file system dependent.  Since there are only patches for
ext4, I choose to make the test around it, since there wouldn't be much
to do with other file systems.  The second challenge is how we cause the
file system errors, since there is no error injection for ext4 in Linux.
In this series, this is done by corrupting specific data in the
test device with the help of debugfs.

The FAN_FS_ERROR feature is flying around linux-ext4 and fsdevel, and
the latest version is available on the branch below:

    https://gitlab.collabora.com/krisman/linux -b fanotify-notifications-single-slot

A proper manpage description is also available on the respective mailing
list, or in the branch below:

Please, let me know your thoughts.
