In the context of the Linux kernel: No.

[ Side note: there might be some DSP out there with a running Linux
kernel which cannot really address a "byte" (meaning 8bits) but only in
register sized quantities (and also aligned for that). But no one cares
here really deeply as that is a so fundamental difference that the C-
compiler must cope with that anyways in the first place. ]

Publish not only results but also everything (complete!) so that anyone
can *easily* follow it to check and reproduce the results - especially
if you want people with knowledge of other architectures to comment
(otherwise they probably won't bother).

Kind regards,
