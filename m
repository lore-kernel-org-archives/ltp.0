But is everything green though?
Does QA department know that if you run samba inside a container
whose storage driver is overlayfs, if samba is configured with
"kernel oplock = yes"
Samba clients would never be able to acquire an oplock and
write performance would be horrible?

Sure, not everyone cares about this case, but seems to be that
silencing the error should be in the hands of the user and that LTP
project should just report the problems as they are.

Worse is the fact that this error will only trigger for people that
configured LTP to test overlayfs specifically, not all LTP users.
This group of users is even more likely to be interested in
bugs/deficiencies of overlayfs.

No, not yet.
Give me a few days to cook.
When I get to caring enough I will fix the kernel ;-)

This too would be wrong practice IMO.
If stable kernel users see that the test passes on mainline and fails
on old kernel, somebody may get the idea to backport the fix to stable kernel
and fix the bug.
IOW, setting min_kver is a tool that should be reserved IMO to situations
where:
1. The interface/functionality does not exist -OR-
2. The maintainers have made it clear that the fix will not be backported

Anyway, just my POV.
I full understand the reasons for the "all green" methodology.

Thanks,
Amir.
