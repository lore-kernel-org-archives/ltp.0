You have 3 more of this typo in fcntl tests.

If you ask me, silencing this error seems wrong.
While the error is *expected* it is still a broken interface.
It may be just a matter of terminology, but I am reading this message as:

TEST PASSED: Overlayfs failed as expected

While it really should be more along the lines of:

TEST SKIPPED: Overlayfs doesn't support write leased

Besides, this problem looks quite easy to fix.
I think Bruce was already looking at changing the implementation of
check_conflicting_open(), so if the test is not failing, nobody is going to
nudge for a fix...

Thanks,
Amir.
